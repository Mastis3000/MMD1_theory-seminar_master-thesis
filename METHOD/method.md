# BUILDING ELECTRONIC MUSIC TOOLS WITH OLD ELECTRONICS
## Method

For this research work, I would like to meet people who build synthesizers, effects modules and other devices for the production of electronic music from old electronic components. The goal would be to question them in relation to their position on electronic waste --> questions to be developed.
So the method will be physical interviews (as far as possible), discovery of workshops, field research about the component recovery/recycling process.
